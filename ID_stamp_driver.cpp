/*
  Write a program that first asks for the number of items to be ID stamped. The program then loops
  as many times as the number that was input. For each loop pass, the program asks for a description
  and generates a unique integer to be the identifier of the item. The program then displays a message
  stating that the unique identifier for the given product it the generated number.
